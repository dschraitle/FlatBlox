List of some shortcomings I've identified in this solution:
* Overlap detection is very wrong, it only really works properly with circles. Given more time, I would properly research how to get the detection correct, and try to bounce ideas off of others on the team. 
* Shapes can be modified outside of the system via public methods, and when that happens, it skips the validation in the system to make sure they don't overlap or go out of bounds. This could be mitigated by having the system clone the object coming in, or keeping its own record of position and size of each shape. The entire adding process could also be reduced to taking in the shape type, size, and position, and have the system create the new shape. The caller would never even touch a Shape object, they would just pass the class name of a shape implementation. That way, the system won't need to be modified to accommodate every new shape type that is created.
* There is no good way to identify a shape once it's been added to the system. If you don't keep a handle to it yourself, you'll probably never see it again. There could be a way to identify the shapes via a name, or the system could somehow give you back an identifier when they get added.
